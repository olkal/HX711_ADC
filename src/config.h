/**
HX711_ADC configuration

Allowed values for "SAMPLES" is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128.
Higher value = improved filtering/smoothing of returned value, but longer setteling time and increased memory usage
Lower value = visa versa

The settling time can be calculated as follows:
Settling time = SAMPLES + IGN_HIGH_SAMPLE + IGN_LOW_SAMPLE / SPS

Example on calculating settling time using the values SAMPLES = 16, IGN_HIGH_SAMPLE = 1, IGN_LOW_SAMPLE = 1, and HX711 sample rate set to 10SPS:
(16+1+1)/10 = 1.8 seconds settling time.

Note that you can also overide (reducing) the number of samples in use at any time with the function: setSamplesInUse(samples).
